// Candy

// There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

// You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

// Each child must have at least one candy.
// Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
// Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
// Example 2:

// Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
// The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

// Constraints:

// n == ratings.length
// 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
